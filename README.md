Description
-----------
The assignment extension Assign Submissions Download enables teachers to download all submissions of an assignment according to an individually defined naming scheme as a ZIP archive. There is also an export function for the submission information.


Usage
----------------

Students have to complete a seminar paper on a specific topic. The lecturer has assessed all assignments online and provided feedback. At the end of the course, the lecturer would now like to archive the assignments and comments locally on their PC. Since each student has chosen a different title for the uploaded file, the lecturer uses the task extension "download assignments renamed" to download all files according to the same naming scheme (e.g. surname_matriculation number_upload title => *Muster_123456789_documentname*) for reasons of clarity.


Installation
------------

* Copy the module code directly to the /local/assignsubmission_download directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (*http://your-moodle-site/admin*) to start the installation
  automatically.

Privacy API
--------------

The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.


Documentation
-------------
You can find further information to the plugin on the [AMC website](https://academic-moodle-cooperation.org/local_assignsubmission_download/).


Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-local_assignsubmission_download/issues/). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
